# Extended_State_Observer
a disturbance rejection-based solution to the problem of robust output regulation of linear systems. The difference between the underlying plant and its nominal mathematical model is represented by two classes of disturbances. The first class is generated by an autonomous linear system while the other class has no specific dynamical structure. Robustness against the first disturbance class is achieved by the internal model principle. Next, in the framework of disturbance rejection control, an extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate and compensate for the second class of disturbances. As a result, the proposed output regulation method can deal with a vast range of uncertainties. The stability of the closed loop system is investigated and results on practical regulation are drawn.
